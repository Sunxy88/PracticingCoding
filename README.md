# PracticingCoding
Keep studying, one push a day.

I use this repository to encourage myself to keep practicing my coding skill (or interview skill you can say) on leetcode.
I hope everyone could get his/her dream job!

# Goal
* Solve one question per day.
* Organize the problem by type if I have time (which means not now).
